# Functional Programming in Javascript

## Imperative vs Declarative

- Imperative

  - Example: OOP
  - Focus on How
  - Stateful
  - We can mutate state
  - Often rely on side-effects

- Declarative
  - Example: Functional Programming
  - Focus on What
  - Stateless
  - Constants, immutability
  - No side-effects

## Functional Style

- Break down the problem using functional decomposition
- Recursion instead of loops
- Higher order functions
- Functional Javascript constructs
- Currying and partial evaluation
